This type of solutions suits for one-time sample extracting solutions, situations when we probably want to make 
additional calculations and create some similar queries.
Cases when we deal with rather small amounts of data or servers with high performance, 
databases in which each operation doesn't costs real money.

The main advantages of this type are simplicity to code and sustainability to mechanic mistakes.
